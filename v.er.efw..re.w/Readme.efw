The new world 
The old world that gave birth to me, were without much physical objects that expressed my whole self. One reason being that I was raised in the backwardness, and war torn third-world. Neverless, there are some humble physical instruments that were possible in shaping the person I am today and who I want to uniquely gift the Future. Unlike other people whose beginning was privileged with an unshakeable social and spiritual foundation, instead I was born in the middle of hatred, as crazed men flew bullets above our heads to settle their differences. The only safe ground was found in the refugee camp, which was the place that raised all that I am till I came to the united states. There is a special notebook, which served as the symbol of education, and since the family had to spent the poor wages earned on other necessities, I couldn’t take the space in the notebook for granted and had to be critical of what was qualified to be written down or not. The worn-out flip flops were symbols of social status, there is no number old enough to express how long I worn the flip flops. They are the only witnesses and evidence of the boundary lines that life drew around my opportunity. Success was being able to eat, farm and sleep in peace. To think anything above those bless success is because of greed and ungratefulness. My colorful Sunday class, is the symbol of spirituality. Though the living in a refugee camp was the only evidence need to disapprove of a loving God. Hope and faith kept us alive where food lacked, and most of all joy kept us content where materialism failed to do so. Among all the few clothes I possessed, only my colorful Sunday dress understood my beauty, and inspired me to live in my depressed imagination far beyond the boundaries of evil men. Lastly, the smiles around me, though not real to all the five senses, the feeling gained from its warmth is brighter is the sun. Since one starts to learn from an early age that happiness is not in the world but in ourselves. When we came to the united states, all these objects were the tools and dreams through which I saw a brighter future.
