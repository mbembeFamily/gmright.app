Thanks for your response!

I tested the suggestion you listed and decided to use:
 eplusr:::._get_private(param)$m_job[exit_status != 0L] 
to extract the unsuccessful runs.

But when I tried the
 param$errors(c(2,4,7,8)) 

but it only showed:

Error: Some of jobs completed unsuccessfully:
2|UNSUCCESSFUL --> [IDF] set_parameters_2.idf + [EPW] IA_DES-MOINES-IAP_725560_10.epw 
4|UNSUCCESSFUL --> [IDF] set_parameters_4.idf + [EPW] IA_DES-MOINES-IAP_725460_10.epw 
7|UNSUCCESSFUL --> [IDF] set_parameters_7.idf + [EPW] IA_DES-MOINES-IAP_725460_10.epw 
8|UNSUCCESSFUL --> [IDF] set_parameters_8.idf + [EPW] IA_DES-MOINES-IAP_725460_10.epw 


I cannot see the details of errors.
